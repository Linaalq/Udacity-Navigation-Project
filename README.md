# Udacity-Navigation-Project

For this project, I have train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.  
The "Navigation-Project" is the first project in Udacitys Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree under Value Based Methods section.

## üçå Trained Agent

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. Thus, the goal of the agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction. Given this information, the agent has learned how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:  

`0` - move forward.  
`1` - move backward.  
`2` - turn left.  
`3` - turn right.  

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

## üçå Implementation
The project was solved by making minor modifications to the DQN code provided as part of the Deep Q-Networks lesson. Where the details of Deep Q-Networks are mentioned in the following [paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf).

## üçå Getting Started
### Step 1
If you haven't already, please follow the instructions in the [course GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/Value-based-methods#dependencies) to set up your Python environment. These instructions can be found in `README.md` at the root of the repository. By following these instructions, you will install PyTorch, the ML-Agents toolkit, and a few more Python packages required to complete the project.

(For Windows users) The ML-Agents toolkit supports Windows 10. While it might be possible to run the ML-Agents toolkit using other versions of Windows, it has not been tested on other versions. Furthermore, the ML-Agents toolkit has not been tested on a Windows VM such as Bootcamp or Parallels.

### Step 2
Download the environment from one of the links below. You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:  

Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)  
Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)  
Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)  
Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)  

Then, place the file in the `p1_navigation/` folder in the course GitHub repository, and unzip (or decompress) the file.

(For Windows users) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.  
(For AWS) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.

### Step 3
After you have followed the instructions above, open `Navigation.ipynb` (located in the `p1_navigation/` folder in the course GitHub repository) and follow the instructions to learn how to use the Python API to control the agent.
